## Description

This is my (another) take on classic arcade game "Asteroids". This time I made it with the Unity engine and C#, both of which I know nothing. 
Current version offers:
- 3 levels of difficulty
- 6 power ups
- handcrafted (in Krita) with love asteroids and enemies
- great, atmospheric soundtrack made with blessing of https://onlinesequencer.net/
- it sort of works

Have Fun!
